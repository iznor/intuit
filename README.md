Hi Israel, 

Regarding the readme file, I would like to share some more points and feelings.

Despite not getting everything I wanted done, I got part of the code working.

The API is returning responses to GET requests with data coming from mongo (ex. /theaters/1/10102022).

I have also planned my assignment for continuous development, so it will be modular and easy to change in the future.

However, my priorities were not perfect, because I did not manage to finish in time (I didn't get to filter the responses), and my code needs a bit of cleaning.

But I would really appreciate it if you could consider the above while looking at my work and writing your feedback.

Thank you !
